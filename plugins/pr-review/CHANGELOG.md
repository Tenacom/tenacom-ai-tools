## Unreleased changes

### New features

### Changes to existing features

### Bugs fixed in this release

- The sandboxed review no longer prompts for permission on commands with shell expansions (or other constructs Claude Code's static analyzer cannot parse) — a Claude Code bug ([anthropics/claude-code#43713](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/43713)) that defeated sandbox auto-allow. A session hook restores the sandbox as the trust boundary; the deny list still blocks network access and code execution.
- The sandboxed review no longer prompts when an agent edits a file it just wrote (for example, revising its working notes); `Edit`/`MultiEdit` are now permitted inside the sandbox.
- Review agents no longer search the filesystem for inputs they were already handed (the diff, the changed-file list), which could waste time or trigger spurious permission prompts.

### Known problems introduced by this release

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/Tenacom/tenacom-ai-tools/releases/tag/pr-review/1.0.1) (2026-06-30)

### Bugs fixed in this release

- Reviews no longer interrupt you with permission prompts for their search commands. A recent Claude Code update renamed the bundled search tools the review relied on, so its searches fell back to forms the sandbox could not auto-approve; search now uses ripgrep (`rg`), with `grep`/`find` as fallbacks, restoring prompt-free reviews.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/Tenacom/tenacom-ai-tools/releases/tag/pr-review/1.0.0) (2026-06-29)
